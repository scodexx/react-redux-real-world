# Redux real world usage

Had this for a while and thought to share.
This project shows an example production ready usage of Redux.

## Usage

1. Make sure you have Node installed
2. CD to the project directory and ``npm run start``. Open your browser and go to [https://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
3. To create a production build, use ``npm run build``

And that's that on that
